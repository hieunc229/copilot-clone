# Captain Stack — Code suggestion for VSCode

[![Captain Stack on Marketplace](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/captainstack.captain-stack.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=captainstack.captain-stack) [![Captain Stack on Marketplace](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/installs-short/captainstack.captain-stack.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=captainstack.captain-stack) [![Discord Chat](https://img.shields.io/discord/864164585070526475.svg)](https://discord.gg/5F5tDsWFmp)

This feature is somewhat similar to Github Copilot's code suggestion. But instead of using AI, it sends your search query to Google, then retrieves StackOverflow, Github Gist answers and autocompletes them for you.

## 1. Install extension from the marketplace

You can search for "Captain Stack" on VSCode Extension Marketplace, or use [Captain Stack direct link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=captainstack.captain-stack) to install. Have questions? [Join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/5F5tDsWFmp)

## 2. How to use

To trigger inline completion, you'll need to type `//find {your keyword}.` (start with `//find`, end with a dot `.`)

For example
```js
//find binary search in javascript.
```

Make sure `Inline Suggest` is `enabled` from the VS Code Settings

## 3. Installation for development

**Check out the installation video: https://youtu.be/MD-kzsF0Scg**

To install and starting Captain Stack:

1. Clone this repository to your PC using `git clone https://github.com/hieunc229/copilot-clone.git .`. Please note there is a dot at the end of the command
   
2. Run `npm install` in the terminal to install dependencies

3. Now, you can start the extension. From the top menu, choose `Run > Start Debugging`.

This will:
- Start a task `npm: watch` to compile the code and watch for changes
- Open a new VSCode window (you should use the extension here)

_Note: When you make changes, you should refresh that window to apply changes. To refresh, open Command Palette (Command+Shift+P on MacOS, or Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows), then choose "Developer: Reload window"_

## 4. Captain Stack configurations

There are a few configurations available for Captain Stack. To open the configurationview:

1. Click on the Cog icon at bottom left
2. Choose **Settings**
3. In the **Search settings** search box, enter "Captain Stack"

### Available settings

- `sites` allows to enable or disable a source site. By the default, only `Stackoverflow` is enabled.

- `maxResults` is the maximum number of results. It's `12` by default. Note: Since Captain Stack will fetch all the results from a page, the final number of results could be more than `maxResults`

---

## 5. Notes

- There are more code sources that should be considered besides StackOverflow
- If you see `unsupported` error message, ignore it

**Limits:**
- The extension uses fetch-node to get page content, and I don't know if there is any fetching limit
- The extension uses querySelector to extract code and other info. There is a risk of either StackOverflow or Google changing its querySelector

If those factor became problems, the extension could be using their official APIs instead.

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Common reasons why you can't run Captain Stack:

- When `Run debugger`, it shows different target options (nodejs, edge, etc.). Your VSCode root directly might be incorrect. Make sure your root directory is the same with the `package.json` file.
- Error message `module "node-fetch" not found...`. You need to run `npm install`
- `canvas.node` was compiled against a different Node.js. [Try to remove canvas](https://github.com/hieunc229/copilot-clone/issues/9) (`npm uninstall canvas`)

### Still not running?

- You haven't enabled the inline completion feature. To enable, set VSCode config `"editor.inlineSuggest.enabled": true`
- It might conflict with some other plugins. You might need to disable plugins to check

If none of the above works, open a thread or join our [Discord channel and have a chat](https://discord.gg/5F5tDsWFmp).
